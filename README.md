# Effective-Deep-Learning-Model-using-Twitter-Records Using Deep Learning


#About the Project:

Actually it is research based learning project that I have presented in VIT SET Conference.
The basic idea behind this reasearch was to build a build a better accuracy model in compare to existing models using the deep learning.
Final 1- contains the existing models
Final 2- contains the proposed Model

And the proposed architecture and more details are in the conference paper above.

#Existing models used:

1. Simple RNN
2. Single layer LSTM
3. Bidirectional Lstm
4. 1D- CNN

#Proposed Model:

Hybrib CNN-LSTM

#Dataset:

The datset was taken from the kaggle for this research based learning project.
